<h1 class="unnumbered" id="precision-upgrades">Precision Upgrades</h1>
<p>We can upgrade the lead-castle setup to make this experiment safer, more efficient, and—most importantly—more educational. Right now, the alignment of the radiation chip, the attenuators, and the detector introduces significant systematic uncertainties. During the experiment, all of these components are placed inside the lead castle and “sandwiched” together by hand. This relies heavily on human precision and eyeballing, which only provides a limited level of accuracy and leads to misalignment, tilt, plate gaps, and inconsistent distances.</p>
<p>To improve this, we need a way to control the positions of all components in the x, y, and z directions. Even small shifts—such as the detector being tilted or the chip not being centered—can produce noticeable errors in the counts. Ideally, all components should be fixed rigidly in place so nothing moves if bumped, and so that the geometry remains consistent throughout the entire procedure.</p>
<p>One solution is to mount all components onto a rigid platform with a hole-grid or a linear stage. A linear stage would allow us to adjust and lock the distance between the source, attenuators, and detector, giving students the ability to intentionally explore geometry. A fixed platform with mounting holes is a simpler alternative that still eliminates misalignment while giving the instructor control over reproducibility.</p>
<p>Next, we need a way to properly secure both the attenuators and the chip. This is straightforward. For the attenuators, we propose a spring-loaded rack or slot-based magazine that holds plates vertically in alignment while allowing students to remove them one at a time without disturbing the others. As plates are removed, the spring or slide mechanism keeps the remaining stack pressed flat, eliminating air gaps and wobble.</p>
<p>For the radiation source, we propose a 3D-printed plastic holder with a shallow indentation sized for the chip. This recess ensures that the chip sits flat and flush every time, with its center aligned with the detector. This makes the radiation path consistent.</p>
<p>Another important upgrade is improving the attenuators used for the <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span>-radiation measurements with the Strontium source. Currently, the lab uses household aluminum foil because aluminum plates are too thick and would block all the <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span>-particles. This foil, however, introduces multiple sources of error: it never lies perfectly flat, its surface is rough and inconsistent, small air gaps form between layers, and because it is so flimsy, it constantly shifts or falls over. We even had to tape the layers together just to handle them, which defeats the purpose of “thin, clean” attenuation. Because of these limitations—and because the foil tears easily—we were only able to obtain three usable data points, which weakens the <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span>-attenuation curve and prevents students from verifying exponential decay properly.</p>
<p>To solve this, we propose replacing foil with precision thin aluminum sheet. These sheets would maintain its shape, lies flat without wrinkles, and comes in very thin, uniform thicknesses (0.2032 mm). This provides all the benefits of aluminum foil while being far more durable, repeatable, and easy to manipulate. These sheets make <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span>-attenuation measurements more accurate and substantially reduce frustration, allowing students to focus on interpreting radiation behavior rather than fighting their equipment.</p>

<h1 class="unnumbered" id="pedagogical-analysis">Pedagogical Analysis</h1>
<p>Although students can complete the current version of this experiment, the limitations of the equipment introduce avoidable obstacles that negatively impact learning. Instead of concentrating on the core goals—understanding radiation attenuation, applying the theory, collecting reliable data, and safely handling the sources—students are forced to spend a disproportionate amount of time on trivial mechanical tasks. These include manually aligning the detector and source by eye, preventing air gaps in the aluminum foil, restacking attenuators without shifting the geometry, and troubleshooting accidental bumps that require restarting an entire data series.</p>
<p>These issues do not deepen learning—they only consume cognitive resources. By upgrading the experimental hardware, we remove these unnecessary burdens and allow students to devote their full attention to the physics itself. This streamlining reduces extraneous cognitive load, minimizes frustration, and creates an environment where students can focus on reasoning, analysis, and building conceptual understanding rather than fighting the equipment.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="reducing-extraneous-cognitive-load-rightarrow-increasing-capacity-for-reasoning-analysis-and-conceptual-learning">Reducing extraneous cognitive load <span class="math inline">⇒</span> increasing capacity for reasoning, analysis, and conceptual learning</h2>
<p>Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 1988) explains that students have a limited working-memory capacity, and that learning suffers when part of that capacity is consumed by unnecessary or poorly designed tasks. In the current version of this experiment—where students must constantly adjust the detector by hand, re-align the chip, restack attenuators, worry about the setup shifting inside the lead castle—much, and following safety protocol—much of their mental effort is spent on extraneous load. These tasks do not contribute to understanding radiation attenuation, decay laws, or data analysis; instead, they compete for the same cognitive resources students need for meaningful learning.</p>
<p>Upgrading the experimental hardware directly reduces this extraneous cognitive load. A fixed detector mount, secure chip holder, and a guided attenuator rack eliminate alignment uncertainty and repeated re-positioning. This frees students’ working memory to focus on the intrinsic goals of the lab: understanding the attenuation law, interpreting the theory behind the experiment, comparing <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>γ</em></span> interactions, analyzing uncertainties, and making sense of their data. According to Cognitive Load Theory, when unnecessary procedural burdens are removed, students are able to process information more deeply, form stronger conceptual connections, and retain information more effectively.</p>
<p>In short, these component improvements do far more than “tidy up” the experiment—they create the cognitive conditions required for students to fully engage with the physics rather than the mechanics.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="blooms-taxonomy">Bloom’s Taxonomy</h2>
<p>Beyond improving accuracy and safety, these component upgrades directly support higher-level cognitive processes in Bloom’s Taxonomy. In the current version of the experiment, students often remain stuck in the lower levels—remembering procedures and applying formulas—because so much effort is spent physically aligning equipment, restacking attenuators, or troubleshooting unstable geometry. These mechanical burdens prevent students from engaging in deeper tasks such as evaluating data quality or designing experimental improvements.</p>
<p>With upgraded components—including fixed mounts, a guided attenuator rack, and a stable chip holder—the procedural overhead is removed. Students are now able to operate at the Analyze and Evaluate levels as they compare attenuation curves, justify experimental geometry, and critique sources of uncertainty. More importantly, the improved stability and reproducibility of the setup allow students to reach the Create level: they can design alternative geometries, propose extensions of the experiment, or develop their own hypotheses about how different materials or thicknesses should affect gamma and beta attenuation.</p>
<p>The goal of these upgrades is not to make the experiment “easier” or “plug-and-chug,” but to free students to think like practicing physicists. Just as early radiation researchers such as Becquerel and the Curies built precise, methodical apparatus to reveal the underlying physics, students in this course will be empowered to design a professional-standard experiment. This shift enables them to connect theory to practice, formulate investigative questions, develop a data-collection plan, and produce meaningful results that can be interpreted, criticized, and discussed with intellectual depth.</p>
